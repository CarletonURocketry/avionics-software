 *
 *  **IMPORTANT NOTE:** If using an older card, the initialization steps must be
 *  executed while the microprocessor/controller is running at a slower clock
 *  rate (100-400 KHz). Newer cards can withstand MHz clocks but older ones will
 *  complain. After initialization is complete, the clock speed may be switched
 *  to a higher one.
 *
 * Supposedly, the proper way to initalize a card over SPI is to:
 *      1. Set the clock speed to 400kHz or less if old card
 *      2. Hold the CS line low and send 80 clock pulses (with bytes 0xFF)
 *      3. Send the "soft reset" command CMD0
 *      4. Wait for the card to respond "ok" with the value 0x01 (0xFF is also
 *          acceptable and indicates the card was in a strange state)
 *      5. Initialize the card:
 *          5a. Send CMD55 followed by ACMD41, if response is 0x05, this is an
 *              old card and CMD1 must be used (step 5b). If response 0x01 for
 *              CMD55 then continue, if response 0x00 for ACMD41 then continue,
 *              if response 0x01 for ACMD41 then repeat this step.
 *          5b. Send in the "initialize card" command CMD1 and repeat this until
 *              the card responds with 0x00.
 *      6. Set sector size using CMD16 with parameter 512
 *      7. Turn off CRC requirement by sending CMD59
 *      8. Next time the card responds with "ok" value it is ready
 *      9. Ramp up clock speed back to normal if step 1 was necessary.
 *
 *  We should also assert CS low at least before and after each CMD is sent
 *  since SD cards are selfish and may assume it's the only SPI device selected
 *  all the time.
