## Avionics Software
Main repository for the avionics software.

Please see the Wiki tab for in-house documentation. There is another repository, guides-and-manuals, for datasheets, git guides, coding standards and other related information.

If you would like to contribute to this repository, make sure you are on one of the CU In Space teams or contact the Avionics Team Lead. Also please read all of the \*.md documentation located in the root directory of this project before contributing.

This is the main stack code, which was developed for a series of microcontrollers used by the CU InSpace team (ATSAMD51P20A-AU microcontroller). The code in this repository was mostly authored by Samuel Dewan. 
The team has elected to switch over to a QNX-based system. This repository will be archived so that team members may review old code during the development of our new microprocessor system. Questions about this repository may be directed toward avionics@cuinspace.ca.
